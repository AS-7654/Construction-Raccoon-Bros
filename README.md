# Construction-Raccoon-Bros
Construction Raccoon Bros is a 3d platformer game (loosely) based on Super Mario 64. You play as a raccoon, and you have to collect 5 stars in each level to move to the next one. There are 3 levels in the game, and after beating World 1-3, the game loops back to World 1-1.  Construction Raccoon Bros was created by the Philly CoderDojo ninja "Wosh."
