                                   STORY
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

One day, the construction raccoon 'Bob' had to save the day by finding 15
stars across 3 construction sites. There isn't very much else to it.

                                HOW TO PLAY
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the arrow keys to move, and press space to jump. Collect stars by
bumping into them. Collect all the stars in a level to win!

There aren't any enemies or obstacles, but some platforms move.

After World 1-3, the game loops.

                               AUTHOR'S NOTE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

By this point you can probably tell this whole game is a love letter to
SM64. I got the inspiration for this game when I was still playing SM64,
when I was at the final level. I tried to beat the final stage for months
before I just lost motivation. I'll get back to it someday.

There would've also been this recurring cat NPC that would've acted as "Mr.
Exposition." At the start of each level, you could talk to him and he'd give
a little bit of info about the level and then start the timer. But the timer
starting function was a little wonky, so he got cut, and I just put all the
story stuff in here.

There's also a rat NPC, he would give you a speed bubble but I can't
remember if I cut that or not. If I didn't, please don't take the speed
bubble. It just makes the game harder.

NOTE: Please check out my new game Mount Bop! I spent a lot of time on it.
