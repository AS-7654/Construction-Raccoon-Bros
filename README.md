CONSTRUCTION RACCOON BROS.
(Wait, who's the other guy???)

STORY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You play as the construction raccoon Bob. Bob needs to find 15 stars across 3
construction sites to win. Find all 15 stars to win!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO PLAY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the arrow keys to move and press space to jump. If you see a star, run
into the star to collect it. Collect 5 stars in each level to go to the next
level. There are 3 levels, after you beat them you can play the whole game
again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AFTERWORD
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wanted this game to be kinda a love letter to Mario 64 and Mario as a whole.
When I started the game I was at the basement with Dry Dry Desert and Lethal
Lava Land. Eventually I made it to the final level Bowser in the Sky but it
was too hard so after about a month and a half I just lost motivation. I hope
I'll beat it someday.

Also the game would've had a cat NPC named Carl, he would've been "Mr.
Exposition," but I cut him for some weird reason.

I also have another game named Mount Bop, but you'll need to view it in the
Turbowarp link in the description:

I'm also thinking of making a Touhou fangame... Maybe crossing it over with
something? It's still a shmup though, I'm probably gonna turn all the
characters into 2hus so it isn't awkward, nobody really wants to see a guy in
a Touhou game.

Sincerely,
-Wosh
